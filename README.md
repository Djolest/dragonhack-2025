# Teamder
A personality-based team matching application that helps you find cohesive team members by matching candidates based on complementary traits and work styles.
# Overview
Teamder uses end to end encrypted personality assesments, to help teams find the right individuals, and individuals find the right teams. We use a science backed algorithm to predict the biggest pros, drawbacks and most importantly give you some guidelines about how to approach
your new team, or your new teammate.

We gave a lot of attention to the science published on the topic of team matching (like those from googles project Aristotle) and consulted with a majour in psichology to find the right approach.
